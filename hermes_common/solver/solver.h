/// Options for matrix factorization reuse.
///
/// Reusing the information computed during previous solution of a similar problem 
/// significantly improves efficiency of the solver. 
///
/// <b>Usage:</b> 
/// Each solver which allows factorization reuse should perform complete factorization 
/// from scratch for the first time it is invoked, keep the precomputed structures 
/// according to the current factorization reuse stratregy and use them for next 
/// factorization.
/// 
/// <b>Enabled solvers:</b>
///   -\c SuperLU - performs reordering, scaling and factorization separately. When the 
///                 multithreaded version is used, scaling is performed during the factorization
///                 phase (if neccessary) and thus \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING
///                 and \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING have the same effect.
///   -\c UMFPack - like the MT version of SuperLU, performs scaling and factorization in one step.
///                 \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING has thus the same effect as
///                 \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING (saves the preceding symbolic analysis step).
///   -\c MUMPS   - If \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING is set, scaling is performed
///                 during analysis and only factorization is repeated during each solve.
///                 If \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING is set, scaling is performed during 
///                 the factorization phase. This may be less efficient, but more reliable,
///                 especially for highly non-symmetric matrices.
///   -\c AMESOS  - Behaves like UMFPack.
///   -\c PETSc   - Factorization reuse applies to the construction of PETSc preconditioner.
///                 Both \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING and 
///                 \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING allow to reuse the non-zero pattern of the
///                 previously created preconditioner, \c HERMES_REUSE_FACTORIZATION_COMPLETELY
///                 indicates that the preconditioner may be reused completely for future solves.
///
/// <b>Typical scenario:</b>
/// When \c rhsonly was set to \c true for the assembly phase, 
/// \c HERMES_REUSE_FACTORIZATION_COMPLETELY should be set for the following solution phase.
